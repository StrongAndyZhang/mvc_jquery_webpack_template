# ASP.Net MVC (Core 3.0)â€” No SPA with Webpack 4, jQuery, Bootstrap, Babel 

This is a sample ASP.Net MVC Core 3.0 project/template with Webpack 4, jQuery, Bootstrap, font-awesome and Babel.

This is not a SPA but rather suggests an approach to utilizing webpack and babel for none SPA projects.

js assets are all contained in a /ClientApp folder for processing. Each route determines which webpack chunk will be dynamically imported.

Importing modules (momentjs) into page/view specific js assets is demonstrated.
